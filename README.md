My .dot-files for neovim and vim

    All of my first manual setup for neovim including my poorly thought out keybinds and plugin configuration, all wrapped my packer.nvim, using nvim-cmp and nvim-lsp. 
    I've always had somewhat of a platonic admiration for neovim, in the sense that it wasn't reciprocal. I really found fascinating the whole philsophy of keyboard-focused navigation. At first, it was overwhelming, but with due time, using basic neovim to gras the general commands and experimenting with prepacked types like lunarvim, astrovim and lazyvim, it always thought a bit overkill.
    Foremost, due to the general purpose philosophy and the hyper fixation with 'ide√©sque' --mostly vscode -- overall look and feel they always tried to mimic. 
    So, after finally felling about making the jump and actually understand I built my first config from zero. There are some incongruencies and excessive redundencies while i grasp the filesystem and my non-linear approach (I googled and :h random topics as I needed them) made some mistakes but here it is. 
    I tried to make it as barebones as possible, aiming only for what I would actually come to use, and still do. While also taking care to make it minimally maintanable ( at least by me ).
    It's just Harpoon, Telescope, nvim-lsp, nvim-cmp, lua-snips ,vimtex and pretty-snippets ( I will eventually delve deeper into lsp/snippet config ). All wrapped by packer.neovim and only .lua files. Oh, and some keybinds as well.
    Buffers are dead, accept Harpoon, it is the way.
